## WetSuite

WetSuite is a web-portal and a collection of tools and resources to accelerate the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to Dutch and EU governmental legal data. WetSuite aims to provide data access and tools both for researchers in law with little or no programming experience, and for researchers in NLP with little or no legal background. We aim to empower individual researchers, facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations, and serve as a stepping stone for legal scholars and students interested in NLP.

To get started with WetSuite's resources, we commend checking out our [decisions tree](https://wetsuite.nl)!

These GitHub repositories support that goal by focused on providing [example notebooks](https://github.com/WetSuiteLeiden/example-notebooks) and tools to play with,
and further down the technical road, data collection and the library code that supports these notebooks
and data collection - with [some API documentation here](https://wetsuite.knobs-dials.com/apidocs/) - yet this is only for the programmers already ready to dive in.
