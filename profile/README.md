## WetSuite

WetSuite will be a web-portal and a collection of tools and resources to accelerate the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to Dutch and EU
governmental legal data.

WetSuite will provide data access and tools both for researchers in law with little or no programming experience,
and for researchers in NLP with little or no legal background.

It will empower individual researchers, facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations, and serve as a stepping stone 
for legal scholars and students interested in NLP.

Our educational materials have a gentler, friendlier introduction,
and provide and step by step guidance of how to get started.

These github repositories support that goal by focused on providing 
intermediate [example notebooks](https://github.com/WetSuiteLeiden/example-notebooks) and tools to play with,
and further down the technical road, data collection and the library code that supports these notebooks
and data collection - with [some API documentation here](https://wetsuite.knobs-dials.com/apidocs/) - yet this is only for the programmers already ready to dive in.
