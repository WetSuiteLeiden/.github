## WetSuite

WetSuite will be a web-portal and a collection of tools and resources to accelerate the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to Dutch and EU
governmental legal data.

WetSuite will provide data access and tools both for researchers in law with little or no programming experience,
and for researchers in NLP with little or no legal background.

It will empower individual researchers, facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations, and serve as a stepping stone 
for legal scholars and students interested in NLP.

Our educational materials have a gentler, friendlier introduction,
and provide and step by step guidance of how to get started.

These github repositories support that goal by focused on providing, data, tools,
and as such is the more technical part, and the starting point for people
ready to tangle with some code, 
and with some intermediate topics in the [example notebooks](https://github.com/WetSuiteLeiden/example-notebooks).

There is also some code that supports those notebooks - with [some API documentation here](https://wetsuite.knobs-dials.com/apidocs/) - yet this is only for the programmers already ready to dive in.
