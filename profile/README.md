## WetSuite

WetSuite will be a web-portal and a collection of tools and resources to accelerate the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to Dutch and EU
governmental legal data. WetSuite will provide data access and tools both for researchers in law with little or no programming experience, and for researchers in
NLP with little or no legal background. It will empower individual researchers, facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations, and serve as a stepping stone for
legal scholars and students interested in NLP.
