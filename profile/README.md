## WetSuite

WetSuite will be a web-portal and a collection of tools and resources to accelerate the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to Dutch and EU
governmental legal data.

WetSuite will provide data access and tools both for researchers in law with little or no programming experience,
and for researchers in NLP with little or no legal background.

It will empower individual researchers, facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations, and serve as a stepping stone 
for legal scholars and students interested in NLP.


Other parts of the encompassing project provides educational materials, 
to be a gentler introduction to the topic,
and step by step guidance of how to get started.

These github repositories support that goal by focused on providing, data, tools,
and as such is the more technical part.

It also includes some intermediate topics in the [example notebooks](https://github.com/WetSuiteLeiden/example-notebooks).

There is also some code that supports those notebooks - with [some API documentation here](https://wetsuite.knobs-dials.com/apidocs/) - yet this is only for the programmers already ready to dive in.
